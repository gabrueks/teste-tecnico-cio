# Technical test
## What's that?
That's a URL crawler to track the links inside html from pages. You can choose a page to start crawling and set it on the code.
<br>
<h3>How can I run it/ how it was build?</h3>
To run the application you have to run in your command line the following commands:<br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrueks/teste-tecnico-cio.git <br>
cd teste-tecnico-cio
make
```

and acess on your browser: http://localhost:3000

And well, how does it run? <br>
Basically, you can run the command "make" only because it triggers two commands from docker-compose: <br>
```bash 
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
